Online Server Chat Application - Java, MySQL, Socket Programming

Built a real-time chat app with full client–server structure, group and private messaging, user login system, and MySQL database connection.
This project is a real-time chat application built in Java, using socket programming to handle communication between the server and all connected clients. 
The server runs on a dedicated port and manages incoming connections, message routing, and room logic. 
A MySQL database stores user accounts, handles registration and login validation, and keeps the data consistent across sessions. 
Once authenticated, the user enters the chat environment, joins a room, and the server coordinates all message exchange between participants. 
This project demonstrates a complete client–server workflow with socket communication, database integration, and a functional user interface.
